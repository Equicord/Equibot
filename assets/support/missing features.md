If global keybinds and possibly some more features aren't working for you, it's likely you installed the Equicord Desktop app.

Equicord Desktop is a standalone independent app that is missing some features from the regular Discord app.

To fix it, stop using Equicord Desktop and switch to regular Discord patched with Equicord. To do so, head over to <https://equicord.org/download> for Download options!

This is well documented in the README, so please pay more attention in the future.
