If you are trying to install plugins from the third party plugins channel, see the pinned message there.
**Do not** ask for further help or you will lose access to support. If you cannot figure it out with the pinned message, it's not for you.

Absolutely no support is provided with such installs. If you want to ask for help with bugs / issues, install the regular way.
