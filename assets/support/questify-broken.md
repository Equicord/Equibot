## Questify isn't auto completing Quests

1. Make sure you have the settings in the image below enabled.
2. Run `/equicord-debug`.

If it says `Discord Desktop` in the `Client` section, you can auto complete all of:

- Video Quests
- Play Game/Activity Quests
- Task in Activity Quests

If it says `Equibop`, `Goofcord`, `Web`, `UserScript`, **or anything other than** `Discord Desktop`, you **cannot** auto complete `Play Game/Activity Quests` Quests.
