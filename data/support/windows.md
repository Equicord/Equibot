Download [VencordInstaller.exe](https://github.com/Vencord/Installer/releases/latest/download/VencordInstaller.exe) and run it

If the above doesn't work/open, for example because you're using Windows 7, 32 bit, or have a bad GPU, you can instead use our terminal based installer.

To do so, open Powershell, run the following command, then follow along with the instructions/prompts

```ps1
iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vencord/Installer/main/install.ps1" -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

> ⚠️ Do not run the installer as Administrator
