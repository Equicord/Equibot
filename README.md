Originally meme bot to give me active dev badge, now just misc bot i have on my server for some utilities.

This bot is extremly specific and not configurable so you shouldn't use it, and for that reason it's also not under
open source license. Literally the only reason I made this repo public is so that I don't have to authorise to clone it on my VPS ðŸšŽ
