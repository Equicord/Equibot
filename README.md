# Vaius

If you are looking at this repo on github, note that it's just a mirror.
The actual repo is [on codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Ven/Vaius) and pull requests and issues should go there!

This bot is extremely specific and not configurable so there is really no reason for you to want to self host it

Nevertheless it is still available under a free software license so you can easily audit and modify it!
